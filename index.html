<h1>Michaung Cyclone</h1>
<p> Cyclone Michaung pummelled Chennai and its neighbouring districts non-stop, dumping 400 to 500mm of rain since Sunday morning, flooding homes and destroying cars and bikes across the coastal metropolis. In 2015, when the 'Chennai deluge' drowned the city, it had received 330mm of rain.</p>
